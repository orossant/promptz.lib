# Contributing to Promptz

Welcome to the Promptz community! This library makes it easy to share your AI development resources with the community. Simply drop your raw Kiro files and create a pull request.

## TL;DR

**Quick Start:**
1. Fork [promptz.lib repository](https://github.com/cremich/promptz.lib)
2. Copy files from your `~/.kiro/` or `<project>/.kiro/` folders
3. Place in appropriate directories: `steering/`, `prompts/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, `powers/`
4. Remove sensitive data, use kebab-case naming
5. Create PR with clear description

**Key Requirements:**
- **Hooks**: Use `.kiro.hook` extension (not `.hook`)
- **Agents**: System prompts optional (inline or `file://./agent-name.md`)
- **Powers**: Only `POWER.md` required (with YAML frontmatter), `mcp.json` optional
- **Everything else**: No frontmatter needed, simple markdown files

**Compatibility:**
- 🟣 **Universal** (CLI + IDE): Steering, Prompts
- 🔵 **CLI Only**: Custom Agents  
- 🟢 **IDE Only**: Agent Hooks, Kiro Powers

## What is Promptz?

Promptz is a community-driven platform that accepts raw Kiro files from your `.kiro` folders. These are the same files you use locally with Kiro IDE and Kiro CLI. The content is stored in the promptz.lib repository and displayed on promptz.dev for the community to discover and use.

## Content Types by Compatibility

Understanding which content works where helps you contribute the right resources:

### 🟣 Universal Content (CLI + IDE)
Works in both Kiro CLI and Kiro IDE environments:

- **Steering Documents** - Development standards and coding guidelines
- **Prompts** - Reusable AI instructions for development tasks

### 🔵 CLI-Only Content
Specialized for command-line workflows:

- **Custom Agents** - AI assistants configured for terminal-based development

### 🟢 IDE-Only Content
Designed for the integrated development environment:

- **Agent Hooks** - Event-driven automation that responds to file changes
- **Kiro Powers** - Complete tool packages with specialized knowledge

## What You Can Contribute

### From Your Global Kiro Folder (`~/.kiro/`)
User-wide configurations that work across all projects:

- **Steering Documents** (`~/.kiro/steering/*.md`) - Personal coding standards and development guidelines
- **Custom Agents** (`~/.kiro/agents/`) - Your custom agent configurations for CLI workflows
- **Prompts** - Reusable AI instructions you've developed

### From Your Workspace Kiro Folders (`<project>/.kiro/`)
Project-specific configurations that could benefit other projects:

- **Project-specific steering** (`<project>/.kiro/steering/*.md`) - Standards for particular frameworks or domains
- **Custom Agents** (`<project>/.kiro/agents/`) - Domain-specific AI assistants for CLI
- **Agent Hooks** (`<project>/.kiro/hooks/`) - Project automation for IDE users
- **Prompts** - Task-specific AI guidance for common development activities

### Kiro Powers
If you've created Kiro powers, you can contribute them to the promptz.lib repository! Powers are complete tool packages that provide specialized knowledge and capabilities. While there's also an official kiro-powers repository from AWS, we welcome community powers in promptz.lib to make them easily discoverable alongside other community resources.

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Find Your Kiro Files

**Global Kiro Folder** (`~/.kiro/`):
- Contains user-wide configurations that apply to all your projects
- Look for: `steering/`, `agents/`, and any prompt files you've created

**Workspace Kiro Folders** (`<project>/.kiro/`):
- Contains project-specific configurations
- Look for: `steering/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, and project-specific prompts

### Step 2: Choose What to Share

**Start with high-impact content:**
- Steering documents that define useful coding standards
- Prompts that solve common development challenges
- Agents that provide specialized assistance for CLI workflows
- Hooks that automate frequent IDE tasks

**Consider broad applicability:**
- Will other developers find this useful?
- Does it solve a common problem?
- Is it generic enough to work in different projects?

### Step 3: Prepare Your Files

1. **Remove sensitive information** - Strip out API keys, personal data, absolute paths
2. **Test your configurations** - Ensure they work in a clean Kiro environment
3. **Use proper naming** - Follow kebab-case convention for all files
4. **Verify file extensions** - Use `.kiro.hook` for hooks, not `.hook`

### Step 4: Fork and Contribute

1. **Fork the repository:**
   - Fork the [promptz.lib repository](https://github.com/cremich/promptz.lib) for all community content including prompts, steering documents, agents, hooks, and powers

2. **Add your files** to the appropriate directories:
   - `steering/` for steering documents
   - `prompts/` for AI prompts  
   - `hooks/` for agent hooks (`.kiro.hook` files)
   - `agents/` for custom agents
   - `powers/` for Kiro powers (separate repository)

3. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear title describing your contribution
   - Description explaining how others can use your content
   - Context about when and why to use your resources

### Step 5: Review Process

1. **Automated validation** - Files are checked for format and safety
2. **Community feedback** - Other contributors may provide suggestions
3. **Maintainer review** - Final approval for quality and appropriateness
4. **Automatic publication** - Approved content appears on promptz.dev

## Content Guidelines

### File Requirements
- **No sensitive data** - Remove API keys, passwords, personal information
- **Use kebab-case naming** - All files should use kebab-case (my-agent-name.json)
- **Generic paths** - Use relative paths or placeholders instead of absolute paths
- **Clear descriptions** - Use descriptive file names that explain the purpose

### Content-Specific Requirements

#### Prompts and Steering Documents
- **No frontmatter required** - Simple markdown files work perfectly
- **Clear, actionable instructions** - Write instructions that AI assistants can follow
- **Standard markdown formatting** - Use proper headers, lists, and code blocks
- **Test with AI assistants** - Verify your prompts work before contributing

#### Custom Agents (CLI)
- **Valid JSON syntax** - Ensure your configuration files are properly formatted
- **System prompts are optional** - Choose inline or file reference based on complexity
- **File naming convention** - If using separate .md file, name it same as .json file
- **Test in clean environment** - Verify agent works without your local dependencies

#### Agent Hooks (IDE)
- **Use .kiro.hook extension** - This is the correct file extension for IDE hooks
- **Valid JSON structure** - Include required fields: enabled, name, description, when, then
- **Clear trigger conditions** - Specify when the hook should activate
- **Test hook behavior** - Ensure hooks work as expected before contributing

#### Kiro Powers (IDE)
- **YAML frontmatter required** - Only content type that needs frontmatter
- **POWER.md is required** - The main documentation file is mandatory
- **mcp.json is optional** - Only include if your power needs MCP server integration
- **Clear keywords** - Help users discover your power with relevant keywords

## Quality Standards

### Before Contributing
- **Test thoroughly** - Ensure your files work in a clean Kiro environment
- **Remove personal data** - Strip out sensitive information, API keys, absolute paths
- **Verify compatibility** - Check that files work with current Kiro versions
- **Document clearly** - Include clear descriptions of purpose and usage
