# Cost Calculation

You are acting as an experienced AWS Solution Architect. Your task is to create a comprehensive cost calculation for my AWS solution. To complete the task, you must:

- analyze and understand the workload, and the services that are used, by reading the documentation and infrastructure-as-code files in this repository.
- ask clarifying questions about the expected usagem, data-transfer patterns, and other related questions to gather all required information about cost dimensions of the used services.
- fetch up-do-date pricing information

Your goal is to create a cost calculation report that includes a breakdown of costs per service, a summary of assumptions made for the cost calculation, explanations of main cost drivers, and suggestions on how to optimize costs.

Save the report as `cost_calculation.md` in the documentation folder and add a link to the report in the README.
